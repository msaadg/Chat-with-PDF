In this study, we develop a theoretical model based on social network theories and ana-
lytical methods  for  exploring  collaboration  (co-authorship)  networks  of  scholars.  We  use
measures from social network analysis (SNA) (i.e., normalized degree centrality, normalized
closeness centrality,  normalized  betweenness  centrality,  normalized  eigenvector  central-
ity, average ties strength, and efﬁciency) for examining the effect of social networks on
the (citation-based)  performance  of  scholars  in  a  given  discipline  (i.e.,  information  sys-
tems). Results  from  our  statistical  analysis  using  a  Poisson  regression  model  suggest  that
research performance  of  scholars  (g-index)  is  positively  correlated  with  four  SNA  measures
except for  the  normalized  betweenness  centrality  and  the  normalized  closeness  centrality
measures. Furthermore,  it  reveals  that  only  normalized  degree  centrality,  efﬁciency,  and
average ties strength have a positive signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the g-index (as a performance
measure). The  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  has  a  negative  signiﬁcant  inﬂuence  on  the
g-index. Based  on  these  results,  we  can  imply  that  scholars,  who  are  connected  to  many
distinct scholars,  have  a  better  citation-based  performance  (g-index)  than  scholars  with
fewer connections. Additionally, scholars with large average ties strengths (i.e., repeated
co-authorships) show  a  better  research  performance  than  those  with  low  tie  strengths  (e.g.,
single co-authorships  with  many  different  scholars).  The  results  related  to  efﬁciency  show
that scholars,  who  maintain  a  strong  co-authorship  relationship  to  only  one  co-author  of  a
group of  linked  co-authors,  perform  better  than  those  researchers  with  many  relationships
to the  same  group  of  linked  co-authors.  The  negative  effect  of  the  normalized  eigenvector
suggests that scholars should work with many students instead of other well-performing
scholars. Consequently,  we  can  state  that  the  professional  social  network  of  researchers
can be  used  to  predict  the  future  performance  of  researchers.

1. Introduction
Performance appraisal is an inevitable function of management at any level. It fosters the development progress.
Consequently,  within  a  research  environment  (i.e.,  universities  and  research  institutes),  there  should  also  be  a  per-
formance  evaluation  for  academics.  This  evaluation  of  researchers,  which  should  be  based  on  the  researcher’s  output
(i.e.,  productivity), is not only needed for performance appraisal but also for faculty recruitment, governmental funding

allocation,  and  for  achieving  a  high  reputation  within  the  research  community.  The  reputation  of  research  organizations
indirectly  affects the society’s welfare, since a high reputation attracts foreign purchases, foreign investments, and highly
qualiﬁed  students  from  around  the  world.
Thus,  there  is  a  need  for  measuring  the  output  of  universities  and  the  output  of  their  researchers.  With  respect  to  gov-
ernmental  funding,  i.e.,  the  allocation  of  funding  to  a  speciﬁc  project,  it  is  important  to  choose  the  most  appropriate  scholars
with  the  aim  of  maximizing  the  research  output,  cost  savings,  and  resource  utilization.  Therefore,  the  main  problem  is  the
identiﬁcation  of  the  most  suitable  scientists,  who  can  achieve  the  goals  (Jiang,  2008 ).
To  assess  the  performance  of  scholars,  many  studies  suggest  quantifying  scholars’  publication  activities  as  a  good  measure
for  the performance of scholars. The general idea is that a researcher gets a high appraisal in the research community, if
the researcher  publishes  and  these  publications  get  cited.  The  number  of  citations  qualiﬁes  the  quantity  of  publications
(Lehmann,  Jackson, & Lautrup, 2006 ). Hirsch (2005) introduced the h-index as a simple measure that combines in a simple
way the quantity of publications and the impact of publications (i.e., number of citations). The h-index is deﬁned as follows:
“A  scientist  has  an  h-index  of  h,  if  h  of  her  Np  papers  have  at  least  h  citations  each,  and  the  other  (Np  −  h)  papers  have  at  most
h  citations  each”  (Hirsch,  2005 ).  In  other  words,  a  scholar  with  an  index  of  h  has  published  h  papers,  which  have  been  cited  at
least  h  times.  Furthermore,  the  h-index  also  became  the  basis  for  a  wide  range  of  new  measures  for  individuals  assessment
(Altmann,  Abbasi, & Hwang, 2009; Batista, Campiteli, & Kinouchi, 2006; Egghe, 2006; Jin, 2006; Sidiropoulos, Katsaros, &
Manolopoulos,  2007;  Tol,  2008 )  and  groups  assessment  (Altmann  et  al.,  2009;  Braun,  Glänzel,  &  Schubert,  2006;  Prathap,
2006;  Schubert,  2007;  Tol,  2008 ),  by  extending  the  previously  mentioned  indices  to  groups  of  scholars.
One  of the most famous and widely used and accepted extension of the h-index is the g-index. The h-index and the g-index
are  well-established  and  widely  used  by  academic  databases  (e.g.,  Web  of  Science1and  Scopus2)  to  measure  the  performance
of  scholars.  The  g-index  has  been  introduced  by  Egghe  (2006)  to  overcome  the  main  shortcomings  of  the  h-index,  namely,
ignoring  the  number  of  citations  in  excess  of  h.  Given  a  set  of  articles  ranked  in  decreasing  order  of  the  number  of  citations
that  they received, the g-index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g articles received (together) at least g2
citations  (Egghe,  2006 ).  The  g-index  takes  into  account  both  quality  and  quantity  of  output  of  researchers  (similar  to  the
h-index)  and  inhabits  the  simplicity  and  feasibility  of  the  h-index.
While  we evaluate associations of different scientiﬁc performance measures (i.e., publications count, citations count,
h-index,  and g-index) with SNA measures in this paper, we use the g-index measure as the main surrogate for quantifying
the  performance  of  researchers  in  our  multivariate  Poisson  regression  model.
The  scientiﬁc  landscape  has  also  seen  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number  of  collaborations  between  scholars.  An  explanation
for  the  rapid  growth  of  international  scientiﬁc  collaboration  has  been  provided  by  Luukkonen  and  his  colleagues  (Luukkonen,
Persson,  &  Sivertsen,  1992;  Luukkonen,  Tijssen,  Persson,  &  Sivertsen,  1993 )  as  well  as  Wagner  and  Leydesdorff  (2005) .  They
state  that,  by  jointly  publishing  papers,  researchers  show  their  knowledge  sharing  activities,  which  are  an  indication  for
knowledge  creation. Stokols, Harvey, Gress, Fuqua, and Phillips (2005) show that an important result of scientiﬁc collabora-
tions  is  the  creation  of  new  scientiﬁc  knowledge,  including  new  research  questions,  new  research  proposals,  new  theories,
and  new  publications.  With  respect  to  the  number  of  new  publications,  empirical  studies  have  been  conducted  by  Lee  and
Bozeman  as well as Duque et al. (2005) . Although Duque et al. (2005) have found that collaboration was not associated with
an  increase  in  scientiﬁc  publications  in  the  developing  countries  of  Ghana,  Kenya,  and  India  (Kerala),  Lee  and  Bozeman  (2005)
show  that  the  total  number  of  publications  for  US  scientists  is  positively  associated  with  the  total  number  of  collaborations.
Consequently,  it  has  been  noticed  that  “the  rising  awareness  of  collaborativeness  in  science  has  led  to  a  sharpened  focus
on  the  collaboration  issue”  (Melin,  2000 ).  Furthermore,  scientiﬁc  collaboration  has  even  been  called  a  “springboard  for
economic  prosperity  and  sustainable  development”  (US  Ofﬁce  of  Science  &  Technology  Policy,  2000 ).  As  most  scientiﬁc
output  is  a  result  of  group  work  and  most  research  projects  are  too  large  for  an  individual  researcher  to  perform,  it  often
needs  scientiﬁc cooperation between individuals across national borders (Leclerc & Gagné, 1994 ). Due to the necessity to
keep  pace  with  scientiﬁc  progress  not  only  at  the  level  of  individual  researchers  but  also  at  the  level  of  countries,  most
governments  are  interested  in  enhancing  the  level  of  international  collaborations  through  policies  (Katz  &  Martin,  1997;  van
Raan,  2004 ).
Since  scientiﬁc  collaborations  can  be  deﬁned  as  “interactions  taking  place  within  a  social  context  among  two  or  more
scientists  that  facilitates  the  sharing  of  meaning  and  completion  of  tasks  with  respect  to  a  mutually  shared,  super-ordinated
goal”  (Sonnenwald,  2007 ).  Those  collaborations  frequently  emerge  from,  and  are  perpetuated  through,  social  networks.  Since
social  networks may span disciplinary, organizational, and national boundaries, social networks can inﬂuence collaborations
in  multiple  ways  (Sonnenwald,  2007 ).
Currently,  however,  it  is  not  clear  which  collaboration  data  is  useful  for  evaluating  the  academic  community.  Although
there  is  a  large  set  of  potential  collaboration  data  (e.g.,  joined  conference  organization,  joined  research  proposal  submissions,
joined  publications,  joined  conference  attendance,  and  teacher–student  relationships),  which  qualiﬁes  for  being  analyzed
through  appropriate  network  measures,  we  only  consider  joined  publications  in  our  study.  For  our  analysis,  we  use  publica-
tion  information  that  is  available  on  the  Internet.  However,  to  restrict  the  data  collection  effort,  we  only  selected  publication
data  of scholars of ﬁve information systems schools (iSchools). For the data collection, we used a Web-based tool (Abbasi &
1http://science.thomsonreuters.com/training/wos/ .
2http://help.scopus.com/robo/projects/schelp/h  hirschgraph.htm .596 A.  Abbasi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Informetrics  5 (2011) 594–  607
Altmann,  2010 ).  Based  on  the  co-authorships  of  those  publications,  we  construct  the  research  collaboration  network  of  these
scholars.  Nodes (actors) of the research collaboration network represent scholars. A link (tie) between two nodes represents
a  publication  co-authorship  relationship  between  those  two  scholars.  Within  the  remainder  of  the  paper,  we  will  refer  to
nodes  and  links  if  we  talk  about  networks  in  general.  The  terms  actors  and  ties  are  used,  if  we  talk  about  the  collaboration
activity  of  scholars.
By  calculating  measures  of  social  network  analysis  (SNA)  and  researcher’s  citation-based  performance  index  (g-index),
we  aim  to  ﬁnd  whether  the  position  of  a  researcher  within  the  collaboration  (co-authorship)  network  correlates  with  the
research  performance  of  this  researcher.  In  particular,  we  investigate  the  following  research  questions:
•Which
 measures  of  SNA  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the  co-authorship-based  research  collaboration  network  of  scholars?
•Is  there  a  correlation  between  measures  of  SNA  and  scholars’  citation-based  performance  measures?
•Which  measures  of  SNA  of  scholars  have  an  impact  on  the  scholar’s  performance,  in  particular  on  g-index?
•What  are  the  implications  of  our  ﬁndings  for  scholars  and  research  communities  with  respect  to  their  productivity
improvement?
The remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Based  on  a  review  of  existing  studies  about  social  network  analysis
measures  and  performance  of  researchers,  we  introduce  our  hypotheses  about  the  usefulness  of  SNA  measures  for  evaluating
research  performance in Section 2. Section 3 describes the data resources, the research methodology applied for the data
collection  and  validation,  and  our  analysis  model.  Section  4  analyzes  the  collaboration  network  of  ﬁve  iSchools.  In  particular,
it presents the results of the Spearman rank correlation test between SNA measures and the performance measure and
also  shows  the  Poisson  multiple  regression  result  on  the  inﬂuence  of  SNA  measures  on  research  performance.  Finally,  we
conclude  the paper with a discussion on the results, the research limitations, and our future work.
2. Social  network  analysis  measures  and  theories
Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations. They play a critical role in determining
the  way problems are solved, organizations are run, markets evolve, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving
their  goals  (Abbasi  &  Altmann,  2010;  Kim  &  Altmann,  2010 ).  Social  networks  have  been  analyzed  to  identify  areas  of  strengths
and  weaknesses  within  and  among  research  organizations,  businesses,  and  nations  as  well  as  to  direct  scientiﬁc  development
and  funding  policies  (Owen-Smith,  Riccaboni,  Pammolli,  &  Powell,  2002;  Sonnenwald,  2007 ).
In  general, the beneﬁt of analyzing social networks is that it can help people to understand how to share professional
knowledge  in  a  efﬁcient  way  and  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  individuals,  groups,  or  the  entire  social  network  (Abbasi  &
Altmann,  2010 ).  For  instance,  with  respect  to  performance  evaluation,  the  social  network  of  a  researcher  within  a  research
community  provides an indication of the researcher’s collaboration activity (Abbasi, Altmann, & Hwang, 2010 ).
2.1. Network  structures
The  “Bavelas–Leavitt  Experiment”  is  one  of  the  earliest  studies  that  relates  human  communication  patterns  to  per-
formance (Bavelas, 1947, 1950; Leavitt, 1951 ). The experiment consisted of several groups by ﬁve members, who had to
communicate  with  each  other  through  enclosed  cubicles  to  solve  a  puzzle.  Several  different  structures  for  communication
channels  between  members  of  the  groups  have  been  found  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Their  result  showed  better  performance  for
the  groups  using  a  “Star”  and  “Y”  structure.  They  inferred  that  centralization  was  the  most  inﬂuential  factor  on  performance
(Leavitt,  1951 ).  However,  other  studies  showed  that  it  is  only  true  for  simple,  standard  and  routine  tasks  (Chung  &  Hossain,
2009 ).  Guetzkow  and  Simon  (1955)  found  that  decentralized  structures  (e.g.,  circle  network)  lead  to  efﬁcient  performance
when  solving complex tasks.

2.2. Centrality measures and theories
Another method  used  to  understand  networks  and  their  participants  is  to  evaluate  the  location  of  nodes  in  the  network.
Measuring  the  network  location  is  about  determining  the  centrality  of  a  node.  These  measures  help  determining  the  impor-
tance  of  a  node  in  the  network.  Bavelas  (1950)  has  been  the  pioneer,  who  initially  investigated  the  formal  properties  of
centrality  and  proposed  several  centrality  concepts.  Later,  Freeman  (1979)  found  that  centrality  has  an  important  structural
inﬂuence  on  leadership,  satisfaction,  and  efﬁciency.  In  particular,  it  could  be  shown  that  betweenness  centrality  and  degree
centrality  inﬂuence  the  performance  of  a  node.
In  addition to this, a node can be central from a local or global perspective. A node is locally central, if it has a large direct
neighborhood of  nodes.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  this  property  does  not  mean  that  the  node  is  a  unique  central  node
in  the network. If a node is globally central, it has a position of strategic signiﬁcance in the overall structure of the network
(Scott, 1991 ).
2.2.1.
 Degree centrality
The simplest and easiest way of measuring node centrality is by measuring the degree of the node in the graph. The
degree  of  a  node  is  simply  the  number  of  other  nodes  connected  directly  to  the  node.  As  degree  of  a  node  is  calculated  in
terms of the number of its adjacent nodes, the degree can be regarded as a measure of local centrality (Scott, 1991 ). Thus,
the  degree centrality of node pkis  given  by:
CD(pk)  =n/summationdisplay
i=1a(pi,  pk)  (1)
where n  is  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  network  and  a(pi,pk)  is  a  distance  function.  a(pi,pk)  =  1,  if  and  only  if  node  piand  node
pkare  connected.  a(pi,pk)  =  0  otherwise.
It  is  not  meaningful  to  compare  a  node  with  a  score  of  40  in  a  network  of  100  nodes  with  a  node  of  score  of  7  in  a  network
by  10 nodes. In order to have a more general measure for comparing the degree centrality of nodes of different networks
with  different  sizes,  Freeman  (1979)  proposed  a  relative  (normalized)  measure.  This  measure  normalizes  the  actual  number
of  links  by  the  maximum  number  of  links  it  could  have.  Thus,  the  normal  (relative)  degree  centrality  of  node  pkis  given  by:
CD/prime(pk)  =/summationtextn
i=1a(pi,  pk)
n  −  1(2)
Having just regular degree centrality measures, we can only compare nodes in networks with the same size. The nor-
malized  centrality measure, however, makes possible the comparison of node centrality across networks with different
sizes.
In practice,  an  actor  with  a  high  degree  centrality  can  inﬂuence  a  group  by  withholding  or  distorting  information  in
transmission  (Bavelas, 1950; Chung & Hossain, 2009; Freeman, 1979; Leavitt, 1951 ). The degree centrality is also an indicator
of  an  actor’s  communication  activity  or  popularity.
2.2.2.
 Closeness centrality
Local centrality  measures  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the  number  of  nodes  to  which  a  node  is  connected  (Scott,  1991 )  but
Freeman  (1979, 1980) proposed closeness as a measure of global centrality in terms of the distance among various nodes.
Therefore,  a node is globally central, if it lies in average at the shortest distance from all other nodes. That means, it is ‘close’
to  all  other  nodes  in  the  network.  Sabidussi  (1966)  used  the  same  concept  in  his  work  as  ‘sum  distance’,  the  sum  of  the
‘geodesic’  distances  (the  shortest  path  between  any  particular  pair  of  nodes  in  a  network)  to  all  other  nodes  in  the  network.
Freeman  (1979,  1980)  deﬁned  closeness  of  a  node  as  the  “sum  of  reciprocal  distance ”  of  that  node  to  any  other  nodes.  So,
closeness  centrally  of  node  pkis  given  by:
CC(pk)  =n/summationdisplay
i=1d(pi,  pk)−1(3)
In  order to use this measure for comparing nodes across networks with different sizes, there is a need to normalize this
measure.  The  measure  can  be  normalized  by  using  the  maximum  possible  distance  between  any  two  nodes  in  a  network  of
n  nodes.  This  value  is  n  −  1.  More  precisely,  the  normalized  closeness  of  node  pkis  given  by:
CC/prime(pk)  =/summationtextn
i=1d(pi,  pk)−1
n  −  1(4)
A node,  which  is  in  the  on  average  nearest  position  to  all  other  nodes,  can  most  efﬁciently  obtain  information.  Therefore,
closeness  is  a  surrogate  measure  for  the  independence  and  efﬁciency  for  communicating  with  other  nodes  in  the  network
(Freeman,  1979 ).598 A.  Abbasi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Informetrics  5 (2011) 594–  607
2.2.3. Betweenness centrality
Freeman (1979)  proposed  another  concept  of  node  centrality,  which  measures  the  number  of  times  a  particular  node
lies  ‘between’  the  various  other  nodes  in  the  network.  This  measure,  which  is  called  betweenness  centrality,  is  deﬁned  as
“the  number  of  shortest  paths  (between  all  pairs  of  nodes)  that  pass  through  a  given  node”  (Borgatti,  1995 ).  Therefore,  the
betweenness  of  node  pkis  given  by:
CB(pk)  =n/summationdisplay
i<n/summationdisplay
jgij(pk)
gij,  i  /=  j  /=  k  (5)
where
 gijis  the  number  of  geodesics  (shortest  paths)  linking  node  piand  node  pjand  gij(pk)  is  the  number  of  geodesics
linking  node  piand  node  pjthat  contains  node  pk.
In  the  same  way,  to  be  able  to  use  this  measure  for  comparing  nodes  across  different  networks  with  different  sizes,
there  is a need to normalize (standardize) this measure. The measure is normalized by the maximum possible num-
ber  of  shortest  paths  (excluding  the  node  under  consideration).  Given  that  the  network  is  undirected,  the  maximum  is:
((n  −  1)(n  −  2))/2  =  (n2−  3n  +  2)/2.  Therefore,  the  normal  (relative)  betweenness  centrality  score  of  node  pkis  given  by:
C/primeB(pk)  =2  ∗  CB(pk)
n2−  3n  +  2(6)
Betweenness is an indicator of the potential of a node (actor), which plays the role of a broker or gatekeeper. It can most
frequently  control  information  ﬂows  in  the  network  (Freeman,  1979 ).
2.2.4. Eigenvector  centrality
Based on the idea that an node is more central if it is linked to nodes that are themselves central (Bonacich, 1972 ), it
is argued  that  the  centrality  of  a  node  does  not  only  depend  on  the  number  of  its  adjacent  nodes  but  also  on  the  values  of
centrality  of  these  adjacent  nodes.  A  node,  which  is  connected  to  many  other  nodes  that  are  themselves  well-connected,
has  a  high  eigenvector  centrality  and  a  node  connected  to  nodes  with  a  few  connections  has  a  much  lower  score  (Lu,  Luo,
Polgar,  & Cao, 2010 ). Therefore, Bonacich (1972) deﬁnes the centrality c(pk)  of  a  node  pkas  positive  multiple  of  the  sum  of
adjacent  centralities,  i.e.:
/NAK ∗ CE(pk)  =n/summationdisplay
k=1(aik∗ CE(pk))  ∀i (7)
Considering
 the  centrality  of  all  nodes  and  representing  c  =  (c(v1),.  .  .,c(vn)),  the  set  of  formulas  can  be  written  in  matrix
notation  as  /NAKc  =  Ac.  This  type  of  equation  is  well-known  and  can  be  solved  by  calculating  the  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors
of  A.  As  Bonacich  (1972)  shows,  only  one  eigenvector  of  the  set  of  resulting  eigenvectors  is  an  appropriate  solution  that  can
serve  as  a  centrality  measure.  As  A  is  the  adjacency-matrix  of  an  undirected  (connected)  graph,  A  is  non-negative  and,  due
to  the  theorem  of  Perron–Frobenius,  there  is  an  eigenvector  of  the  maximal  eigenvalue  with  only  non-negative  (positive)
entries  (Ruhnau,  2000 ).
In  the  same  way  as  for  the  other  measures,  there  is  a  normalized  version  of  the  eigenvector  measure.  We  use  the  Euclidean-
norm  for normalizing the eigenvector centrality:
C/prime
E(pk)  =CE(pk)/radicalBig/summationtextn
i=1CE(pi)2(8)
The normalized  eigenvector  centrality  is  in  the  range  [0,(0.5)0.5].  This  deﬁnition  of  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  is
not  to  be  confused  with  the  deﬁnition  used  in  UCINET  by  Borgatti,  Everett,  and  Freeman  (2002) .  Furthermore,  the  normalized
eigenvector  centrality  can  be  scaled  “by  the  square  root  of  one  half,  which  is  the  maximum  score  attainable  in  any  graph”
(Borgatti  &  Everett,  1997 ):
CE(pk) =√
2C/prime
E(pk) (9)
For our  analysis,  we  consider  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  C/prime/prime

2.2.5. Centrality-related  hypotheses
In line  with  these  arguments,  it  is  expected  that  authors  have  a  high  potential  to  have  good  performance,  if  they  have
many  collaborations  (links),  are  the  closest  authors  to  all  other  authors,  are  on  many  geodesic  paths  between  other  pairs  of
authors,  and  are  connected  with  other  centrally  located  authors.  That  means  good-performing  authors  are  in  the  center  of
a collaboration network. As the performance measure of scholars, as explained earlier, the g-index is used. Therefore, the
following  hypotheses  are  formally  derived  as:A.  Abbasi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Informetrics  5 (2011) 594–  607 599
•H1a :
 Normalized  degree  centrality  of  a  scholar  impacts  her  research  performance  (e.g.,  g-index).
•H1b :  Normalized  closeness  centrality  of  a  scholar  impacts  her  research  performance  (e.g.,  g-index).
•H1c :  Normalized  betweenness  centrality  of  a  scholar  impacts  her  research  performance  (e.g.,  g-index).
•H1d :  Normalized  eigenvector  centrality  of  a  scholar  impacts  her  research  performance  (e.g.,  g-index).
2.3.
 Tie  strengths  theories
Another point of view to analyze actors of a network has been introduced by Granovetter (1973) . He established the
theory of  the  ‘strength  of  weak  ties’,  which  argues  that  an  individual  obtains  new  and  novel  information  from  weak  ties
rather  than  from  strong  ties  within  the  individual’s  group  structure.  It  is  because  new  information  originates  via  weak  ties,
which  serve  as  bridges  to  different  clusters  of  people  (Chung  &  Hossain,  2009 ).  Granovetter  (1973)  deﬁned  strength  of  a
tie  as “a combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual conﬁding), and the reciprocal
services which  characterize  the  tie”.
Contrarily,  Krackhardt (1992) showed that strong ties are important in the generation of trust. He introduced the theory of
‘strength  of  strong  ties’  in  contrast  to  Granovetter’s  (1973)  theory.  Levin  and  Cross  (2004)  found  that  strong  ties,  more  so  than
weak  ties,  lead  to  the  receipt  of  useful  knowledge  for  improving  performance  in  knowledge-intensive  work  areas.  However,
controlled  for the dimension of trust, the structural beneﬁt of weak ties emerged in their research model. It suggests that the
weak ties  provide  access  to  non-redundant  information.  Weak  ties  facilitate  faster  project  completion  times,  if  the  project
is  simple.  It  enables  faster  search  for  useful  knowledge  among  other  organizational  subunits.  Strong  ties  foster  complex
knowledge  transfer,  if  knowledge  is  highly  complex  (Hansen,  1999;  Reagans  &  Zuckerman,  2001 ).
For  a  weighted  network  (graph),  the  strength  of  a  tie  (link  between  two  nodes)  simply  is  the  weight  of  the  link.  In  our
model,  ties  are  weighted  by  the  number  of  collaborations  between  two  co-authors.
To  evaluate  a  node’s  ties  strength,  we  calculate  the  average  of  the  weights  of  his  co-authorships  (ties).  That  means  we
divide  the  sum  of  the  node’s  tie  weights  (i.e.,  the  number  of  collaborations  of  the  scholar)  by  the  degree  of  the  node  (i.e.,  the
scholar’s  total number of different co-authors). The average ties strength TS of node pkis  given  by:
TS(pk)  =n/summationdisplay
i=1Wki
CD(pk)(10)
where Wkirepresents  the  weights  of  the  ties  between  node  pkand  node  piand  CD(pk)  represents  degree  centrality  of  node
pk.
Thus, based on these deﬁnitions of strength of ties, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H2 Average  ties strength of a scholar impacts her research performance (e.g., g-index).
2.4.
 Structural  holes  theory  and  efﬁciency
Freeman’s  (1979)  approach  to  betweenness  is  build  around  the  concept  of  ‘local  dependency’.  A  node  piis  dependent
upon another node pj,  if  paths  which  connect  it  to  other  nodes  pass  through  node  pj(Scott,  1991 ).  Burt  (1995)  has  described
this  in  terms  of  ‘structural  holes’  and  made  an  inﬂuential  contribution  to  the  phenomena  of  structural  effects  on  individual
outcome  by  relating  the  theory  of  structural  holes  to  network  structure  and  network  position.  A  structural  hole  exists  where
two  nodes  are  connected  at  a  distance  of  2  but  not  at  distance  of  1.  The  existence  of  a  structural  hole  allows  the  third  node
(i.e.,  the node which is between the two nodes) to act as a broker or intermediary (Scott, 1991 ). In other words, holes in the
network  refer  to  the  absence  of  links  that  would  otherwise  connect  unconnected  clusters  together.  Individuals,  who  bridge
these  holes,  attain  an  advantageous  position  that  yields  information  and  control  beneﬁts  (Burt,  1995 ).  Structural  holes  theory
is  based  on  betweenness  centrality.
Burt  uses  the  theory  of  structural  holes  to  optimize  a  network.  Burt  claims  that  increasing  the  number  of  direct  contacts
(ego-network  size)  without  considering  the  diversity  reached  by  the  contacts  makes  the  network  inefﬁcient  in  many  ways
(Burt,  1995;  Chung,  2009 ).  Therefore,  the  number  of  non-redundant  contacts  (i.e.,  the  four  nodes  in  Network  B  of  Fig.  2)  is
important  to the extent that redundant contacts would lead to the same people and, hence, provide the same information
and  control  beneﬁts.  Besides,  the  Network  A  of  Fig.  2  is  inefﬁcient  as  the  node  (“ego”)  gets  only  redundant  information  from
Fig. 2. Two networks with structural holes, while network A is less efﬁcient than network B. Adapted from Burt (1995) .600 A.  Abbasi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Informetrics  5 (2011) 594–  607
its primary contacts. This node is wasting its resources to maintain its ties to all actors of the same cluster, which usually
spread the same information. Non-redundant collaborators, however, give access to a diversity of information, which usually
leads  to  innovation  and  high  performance.
Since  this  deﬁnition  of  efﬁciency  of  a  node  appears  to  be  helpful  in  the  context  of  our  research  collaboration  network,  we
follow  the  deﬁnitions  of  Burt  (1995,  2009) .  In  detail,  efﬁciency  is  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  the  total  number  of  disjoint  groups
of  primary  nodes  (i.e.,  neighbors)  of  node  pk,  where  the  nodes  of  such  a  group  are  only  connected  to  nodes  of  the  same  group
but  not  to  nodes  of  other  groups,  and  the  number  of  primary  nodes  of  node  pk(i.e.,  the  degree  centrality  of  node  pk).  Thus,
efﬁciency  of  node  pkis given by:
E(pk)  =g(pk)
CD(pk)(11)
where
 g(pk)  denotes  the  number  of  disjoint  groups  of  primary  contacts  of  pkand  CD(pk)  represents  degree  centrality  of  node
pk.
With  respect  to  our  study,  a  disjoint  group  of  primary  contacts  relates  to  co-authors  that  have  joined  publications.
Therefore,  testing  this  property  means  testing  whether  a  scholar  maintains  strong  relationships  with  all  co-authors  of  a
group of linked co-authors or whether the scholar focus on a strong relationship with just one co-author of this group.
Therefore, in order to test this property, we formulate the following hypothesis:
H3 The  scholar’s  efﬁcient  use  of  co-authors  impacts  her  research  performance  (e.g.,  g-index).
3.
 Data  and  methodology
3.1.  Data  collection
For this  study,  we  collected  data  on  the  information  schools  (iSchools)  of  ﬁve  universities:  University  of  Pittsburgh,
University  of  Berkley,  University  of  Maryland,  University  of  Michigan,  and  Syracuse  University.  These  schools  have  been
chosen,  since they offer similar programs in the area of information management and systems, and since the topic of these
schools is new within the university landscape.
The  data  sources  used  are  the  school  reports,  which  include  the  list  of  publications  of  their  scholars,  DBLP  (http://www.
informatik.uni-trier.de/ ∼ley/db ),  Google  Scholar  (http://scholar.google.com ),  and  ACM  portal  (http://portal.acm.org ).  Cita-
tion  data has been taken from Google Scholar and ACM Portal, using AcaSoNet (Abbasi & Altmann, 2010 ). AcaSoNet is a
Web-based  application for extracting publication information (e.g., author names, title, publication date, publisher, and
number  of  citations)  from  the  Web.  It  also  extracts  relationships  (e.g.,  co-authorships)  between  researchers  and  stores  the
data  in  the  format  of  tables  in  its  local  database.
For  its citation counting service, Google Scholar considers a variety of publication databases, which belong to different
publishers  and  list  different  types  of  publications.  Thus,  it  produces  a  higher  publication  count  per  researcher  and  a  higher
citation  count  per  publication  than  other  citation  counting  services  (e.g.,  Web  of  Science  of  Thomson  Reuters,  and  Scopus)
(Kousha  &  Thelwall,  2007 ).  Consequently,  the  calculation  of  the  h-index  and  the  g-index,  if  based  on  Google  Scholar,  results
in  higher values than for the other citation counting services. However, Ruane and Tol (2008) showed that rankings based
on  Google  Scholar  have  a  high  rank  correlation  with  rankings  based  on  Web  of  Science  or  Scopus.
For  our  analysis,  we  followed  Google  Scholars  approach  and  did  not  differentiate  between  the  different  types  of  publi-
cations  (e.g., proceedings of local conferences, proceedings of international conferences, journals, books, and presentations
were  weighted  equally).  Our  data  covered  a  period  of  5  years  (2001–2005),  except  for  the  University  of  Maryland  iSchool,
which  had  no  data  for  the  year  2002  in  their  report.  To  resolve  this  issue,  we  substituted  the  missing  data  with  data  of  the
year  2006.  As  we  do  not  apply  longitudinal  analysis,  this  does  not  constitute  a  problem.
Despite  AcaSoNet, much data cleansing has become necessary in order to allow processing of the extracted publication
data.  Most  of  the  cleansing  was  due  to  the  lack  of  a  single  standard  format  used  for  listing  publications  (e.g.,  the  order  of  ﬁrst
name  and  family  name  of  authors,  the  order  of  title  and  publication  year  and  the  inaccuracy  in  writing  journal  and  conference
names).  After the cleansing of the publication data of the ﬁve iSchools, data about 2139 publications, 1806 authors, and 5310
co-authorships  was  ﬁnally  available  for  our  analysis.  Table  1  shows  a  characterization  of  the  co-authorship  network  with
respect  to  the  ﬁve  iSchools.  In  particular,  it  highlights  the  number  of  professors  and  the  number  of  authors  within  the
different  iSchools.

3.2.  Methodology
Social  networks  are  represented  as  graphs,  which  are  constructed  of  nodes  (actors)  and  links  (ties).  Nodes,  which  denote
individuals,  organizations,  or  information,  are  linked,  if  one  or  more  speciﬁc  types  of  ties  (e.g.,  ﬁnancial  exchange,  friendship,
trade,  and Web links) exist between them. For example, a node could represent a person and a link between two nodes could
represent  that  these  two  persons  know  each  other.
The  co-authorship  network  (i.e.,  the  research  collaboration  network)  is  represented  through  a  graph.  The  nodes  (actors,
participants,  vertices) i of the graph represent researchers (scholars). A link (tie, relation, edge) aijbetween  node  i  and  node  j
indicates a collaboration relationship between nodes, based on the co-authorship of researchers on publications. Publications,
of  which  the  author  is  the  sole  author,  are  presented  through  loops  (i.e.,  a  link  from  a  node  to  itself)  in  the  graph.  The  weight
of  a  link  wijdenotes  the  number  of  publications  that  two  researchers  co-authored.  Fig.  3  shows  the  internal  co-authorship
network  of the Pittsburgh iSchools’ faculty as an example. Different link weights are indicated through different colors and
link  strengths.
After  preparing  the  social  network  matrix,  we  used  UCINET  (Borgatti  et  al.,  2002 )  as  a  tool  for  visualizing  the  network
and  for calculating the network measures (i.e., normalized degree centrality, normalized betweenness centrality, normal-
ized  closeness centrality, normalized eigenvector centrality, ties strength, and efﬁciency of each node of the co-authorship
network  (i.e.,  the  research  collaboration  network).
In  the  next  step,  after  calculating  the  scholar’s  network  measures  and  the  g-index,  we  use  the  Spearman  rank  correlation
test  to  test  our  hypotheses  (Fig.  4)  and  to  ﬁnd  the  associations  between  independent  variables  and  dependant  variable.
Finally,  to  ﬁnd  the  predicators  of  the  research  performance  measure,  we  use  a  Poisson  multiple  regression  model.  We  use
Poisson  regression  model,  since  the  observations  of  g-index  values  can  be  assumed  to  be  Poisson  distributed.  Besides,  the
maximum  likelihood  method  used  can  scope  with  potential  multi-collinearity  between  the  independent  variables.  A  Poisson
regression  model is suited as our dependent variable (g-index) is a simple transformation of the citation count variable, is
not  over-dispersed,  and  does  not  have  an  excessive  number  of  zeros  (about  15%).
The  results  of  the  analysis  of  the  ﬁve  co-authorship  networks,  representing  the  collaborations  of  researchers  of  each  of
the  ﬁve  iSchools,  is  shown  in  this  paper  and  discussed.

4. Analysis and results
Using our  data,  we  calculate  the  SNA  measures  of  our  model  and  the  g-index  for  all  scholars  of  all  ﬁve  iSchools.  The  results
for  the  top  30  performing  scholars  are  shown  in  Table  2.
4.1. Spearman  rank  correlation  test
We test  our  hypotheses  based  on  the  data  of  Table  2  but  for  all  researchers.  For  this,  the  Spearman  rank  correlation
test  is  used.  In  particular,  we  calculate  the  Spearman  rank  correlation  coefﬁcient  between  the  six  SNA  measures  and  four
performance measures  (i.e.,  the  publication  count,  the  citation  count,  the  h-index,  and  the  g-index).  The  results  are  shown
in  Table  3.
As  the  results  show,  the  correlation  coefﬁcients  between  the  SNA  measures  (i.e.,  normalized  degree  centrality,  normalized
betweenness  centrality,  efﬁciency,  and  average  ties  strength)  and  the  performance  measures  are  high.  An  exception  is

only  the  normalized  closeness  centrality  and  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality.  The  normalized  closeness  centrality
measure  of  researchers  does  not  correlate  to  scholars’  publication  count  and  citation  count.  It  shows  also  only  a  very  little
but  signiﬁcant  correlations  with  the  h-index  and  the  g-index.  Besides,  the  eigenvector  centrality  measure  correlates  only
very  little  with  the  citation  count.
Considering  the  g-index  measure  as  the  main  indicator  of  scholars’  performance,  the  Spearman  rank  correlation  coefﬁcient
shows  a  signiﬁcant  positive  correlation  with  four  of  the  six  SNA  measures  (i.e.,  normalized  degree  centrality,  betweenness
centrality,  average  ties  strength,  and  efﬁciency).  The  g-index  is  not  correlated  with  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality
measure  and shows only a very little correlation with the normalized closeness centrality measure. Besides, the signiﬁcance
level  and  the  correlation  for  ties  strength  and  betweenness  centrality  are  higher  than  for  the  efﬁciency  measure  and  the
degree  centrality  measure.
Based  on  these  results,  we  can  state  that  there  is  correlation  between  four  SNA  measures  (i.e.,  normalized  degree
centrality,  normalized betweenness centrality, efﬁciency, and average ties strength) and the research performance (i.e.,
publication  count,  citation  count,  h-index,  and  g-index).  Positively  signiﬁcant  correlations  expose  that  researchers,  who  are
more  central  (i.e.,  having  many  collaborations  with  different  scholars;  being  frequently  between  the  collaboration  paths
of  other  scholars;  maintaining  collaborations  with  one  scholar  of  a  group  of  collaborating  scholars)  are  more  productive.
In  addition to this, scholars, who have strong ties (i.e., repeated co-authorships) to co-authors, have a better research
performance  than  those  with  low  ties  (e.g.,  single  co-authorships  with  many  different  co-authors).  Therefore,  the  theory  of
‘Strength  of  Strong  Ties’  by  Krackhardt  (1992) ,  which  has  been  explained  in  an  earlier  section  is  supported  by  our  analysis.
Besides,  the  positive  correlation  between  the  performance  measures  and  efﬁciency  shows  that  researchers  have  to  be
selective  about  the  ties  that  they  maintain,  following  Burt  (1995) .  Thus,  non-redundant  co-authorship  relationships  (i.e.,
maintaining  strong  relationships  to  only  one  co-author  of  a  group  of  linked  co-authors  (highly  connected  together))  will
result  in  improved  performance  of  the  scholar.
Compared  with  the  result  shown  in  Abbasi  and  Altmann  (2011) ,  it  becomes  obvious  that  the  data  set  used  has  a  tremen-
dous  impact on the correlation results. While in the previous study only professors had been considered, this study comprises
professors,  students  and  collaborating  researchers  of  professors  at  the  ﬁve  iSchools.  As  Table  1  shows,  the  number  of  authors
of  an  iSchool  is  manifold  higher  than  the  number  of  professors.  Professors,  who  have  a  higher  performance  measure  than
students,  have  a  brokering  role,  connecting  their  students  to  other  researchers.  Consequently,  the  normalized  betweenness
centrality  in  this  study  gets  higher  correlation  with  the  performance  measures.  At  the  same  time,  because  of  the  many  rela-
tionships  of  professors  with  their  students,  the  eigenvector  centrality  measure  of  the  professor  is  low  because  of  the  many
surrounding  authors  (students),  which  also  have  a  low  eigenvector  centrality  measure.
4.2.
 Poisson  multiple  regression
Since  our  Spearman  rank  correlation  analysis  shows  only  the  existence  of  relationships  between  SNA  measures  and
performance measures but not the effect of independent variables on dependent variables, we use a multivariate regression
model  (multiple  regression  analysis).  Gibbons  (1982)  has  been  the  ﬁrst  to  suggest  a  multivariate  regression  model  (MVRM)
methodology  to  measure  the  effect  of  new  information  on  asset  prices.  Later  Binder  (1985)  showed  advantages  of  the  MVRM
methodology  over  other  event  study  methodologies.  With  our  MVRM,  we  test  the  effects  of  co-authorship  network  measures
(independent  variables)  on  the  author’s  performance  measures  (dependent  variable).
In  particular,  we  run  a  Poisson  multiple  regression  model,  in  order  to  identify  which  of  the  independent  variables  (SNA
measures)  impacts the dependent variable (g-index). The Poisson regression models the log of the expected count as a
function  of the predictor variables. For this regression, we executed the Poisson regression with the robust option (i.e., to
get  robust  standard  errors  for  the  Poisson  regression  coefﬁcients)  in  our  statistical  software  (SPSS).
As  Table  4  indicates,  comparing  the  ﬁtted  model  against  the  intercept-only  model,  the  model  is  signiﬁcant  (p  =  0.000).
The  result  of  the  multiple  regression  model  show  (Table  5)  that  the  signiﬁcant  variables  are  normalized  degree  centrality
(ˇ  =  16.799,  p  =  0.000),  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  (ˇ  =  −3.441,  p  =  0.001),  efﬁciency  (ˇ  =  1.157,  p  =  0.000)  and  average
ties  strength  (ˇ  =  0.386,  p  =  0.000).  The  ˇ  values  are  the  estimated  Poisson  regression  coefﬁcients  for  the  model.  As  expected
from  the  results  of  the  Spearman  rank  correlation,  the  normalized  closeness  centrality  measure  is  not  signiﬁcant  in  this
regression.  As a surprise, at the ﬁrst glance, comes that the normalized betweenness centrality coefﬁcient is not signiﬁcant
but  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  coefﬁcient  (which  is  even  negative).  At  the  second  glance,  it  becomes  clear  that
the  ranking,  which  is  based  on  the  betweenness  centrality  measure,  positions  professors  higher  than  students.  The  absolute
values  of  the  between  centrality  measure,  however,  do  not  differ  largely  within  the  network.  With  respect  to  the  normalized
eigenvector  centrality  measure,  it  can  be  stated  that  a  professor  is  more  successful  if  the  professor  has  many  students  around
instead of successful colleagues.604 A.  Abbasi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Informetrics  5 (2011) 594–  607

Based  on  this  regression  result  (i.e.,  low  signiﬁcance  of  the  normalized  closeness  centrality,  and  the  normalized  between-
ness  centrality), we execute a second regression with four independent variables only: normalized degree centrality,
normalized  eigenvector  centrality,  efﬁciency,  and  average  ties  strength.  The  omnibus  test  for  this  regression  shows  also
its  signiﬁcance  (p  =  0.000)  against  the  intercept-only  model  (Table  6).  All  independent  variables  are  signiﬁcant  (p  =  0.000).  It
is  to  note  that  the  coefﬁcients  of  average  ties  strength,  efﬁciency,  normalized  eigenvector  centrality,  and  normalized  degree
centrality  only changed slightly, compared to the previous regression. This illustrates the stability of the model. The high
Wald chi-square values, shown in Table 7, suggest that the coefﬁcients describe the log( g-index) well.
Therefore,  taking  the  results  of  our  regression,  the  regression  equation  for  our  analysis  can  be  written  as:
Loge(g-index)  =  −0.762  +  (17.681  ∗  CD)  −  (3.587  ∗  CE)  +  (1.181  ∗  E)  +  (0.386  ∗  TS)  (12)
This  can be interpreted as, having one more publications with a new researcher in a collaboration network of 100
researchers (i.e., increasing normalized degree centrality by 0.01) will increase the g-index by approximately one unit
(1.193 =  e(17.681*0.01)),  assuming  all  other  variables  constant.  In  reality  though,  adding  one  co-author  will  not  change  one
centrality  measure but all centrality measures.
4.3.  Discussion of hypotheses
Based on our analysis, we can state that the two independent variables, normalized closeness centrality and normalized
betweenness  centrality,  do  not  show  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  the  g-index  performance  measure.  Although  the  normalized
betweenness  centrality  showed  a  positive  Spearman  rank  correlation,  even  this  independent  variable  was  not  a  signiﬁcant
predictor  in  the  regression  model.  The  reason  is  the  dominance  of  the  high-performing  professors.  They  have  many  students
around  them in the network. This causes to rank them higher than the students with respect to the normalized betweenness
centrality  and, at the same time, gives them a low normalized eigenvector centrality rank (because of the low values). Thus,
we  can  only  accept  hypotheses  H1a,  H1d,  H2  and  H3  and  infer  that:
•H1a : Normalized  degree  centrality  of  a  researcher  has  a  (positive)  impact  on  her  research  performance  (g-index).
•H1d :  Normalized  eigenvector  centrality  of  a  researcher  has  a  (negative)  impact  on  her  research  performance  (g-index).
•H2:
 Average  ties  strength  of  a  researcher  has  a  (positive)  impact  on  her  research  performance  (g-index).
•H3: Efﬁciency  of  a  researcher  has  a  (positive)  impact  on  her  research  performance  (g-index).

Consequently, we can state that the researcher performance will improve, if the researcher has many distinct co-authors,
has repeated collaborations with each of her co-authors, and is connected to a single researcher of a disjoint group of
researchers.  That  means,  scholars  should  not  only  keep  strong  relationships  with  existing  co-authors  and  build  on  former
co-authorships  but  also  try  to  have  collaborations  with  new  authors.  However,  in  order  to  increase  the  efﬁciency,  scholars
should  only  keep  strong  relationships  with  one  co-author  of  a  group  of  linked  researchers.
On  the  other  hand,  being  close  to  other  researchers  (in  the  average  nearest  position  to  all  other  authors)  and  also  hav-
ing  a  brokerage  position  among  researchers  in  a  co-authorship  network  does  not  have  an  effect  on  the  performance  of
the  researcher.  It  suggests  that  there  is  a  high  chance  of  receiving  redundant  information  from  that  group  of  connected
researchers  which may lead to a low performance.
Besides, as  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  reﬂects  a  researcher’s  connections  to  other  well-connected  people  (Lu
et  al., 2010 ), our results suggest that the performance can be increases by collaborating with many students or researchers
that have a low performance record at the time of the collaboration.
5. Discussion  and  conclusion
In order  to  improve  the  beneﬁt  from  research  (and  research  funding),  well-performing  researchers,  who  can  manage
and  control  a  scientiﬁc  research  group,  have  to  be  identiﬁed.  As  past  research  has  shown,  the  g-index  can  be  a  surrogate
for  evaluating  the  research  performance  of  scholars.  To  measure  the  collaboration  skills  of  researchers,  which  became  more
and  more important for research management over the past years, the co-authorships are often used. Consequently, we
considered  both  in  this  study.
In  particular,  in  order  to  investigate  whether  the  collaboration  skills  are  correlated  with  and  have  an  impact  on  the
research  performance  of  researchers,  we  used  a  co-authorship  data  set  of  professors  and  students  of  5  iSchools.  The  co-
authorship  data is used to derive the collaboration network of researchers. The analysis of the collaboration network is
performed  by  applying  social  network  analysis  measures.  The  social  network  analysis  measures  used  are:  the  normalized
degree  centrality,  the  normalized  closeness  centrality,  the  normalized  betweenness  centrality,  the  normalized  eigenvector
centrality,  the average ties strength, and the efﬁciency. Our analysis comprised a Spearman rank correlation analysis and a
regression  analysis.
The  results  of  our  Spearman  rank  correlation  analysis  show  that  the  research  performance  is  positively  associated  with  all
social  network  measures.  However,  the  coefﬁcient  correlations  for  normalized  degree  centrality  and  normalized  between-
ness  centrality,  average  ties  strength,  and  efﬁciency  are  the  highest  and  signiﬁcant.  With  respect  to  the  normalized  degree
centrality,  scholars,  who  are  connected  to  many  different  scholars,  show  better  performance  than  those  with  fewer  con-
nections.  Scholars  with  strong  ties  (i.e.,  repeated  co-authorships)  show  a  better  research  performance  than  those  with
low  ties (e.g., single co-authorships with many co-authors). With respect to efﬁciency, scholars, who maintain strong
co-authorship  relationships  to  only  one  co-author  of  a  group  of  linked  co-authors  (i.e.,  co-authors  that  have  also  joined
publications)  perform  better  than  scholars  with  relationships  to  many  co-authors  of  a  group  of  linked  co-authors.  There-
fore,  we can state that scholars should avoid collaboration with authors within the same cluster. It would lead to lower
efﬁciency.
Performing a  multiple  Poisson  regression  analysis  for  identifying  which  social  network  measure  inﬂuences  the  perfor-
mance  of  scholars,  we  found  that  normalized  degree  centrality,  normalized  eigenvector  centrality,  average  ties  strength,
and  efﬁciency  are  correlated  with  scholars’  performance  (i.e.,  the  g-index).  However,  only  the  normalized  degree  centrality,
the  average  ties  strength,  and  the  efﬁciency  have  positive  effects  on  scholars’  citation-based  performance  (g-index)  and  the
normalized  eigenvector  centrality  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  g-index.  These  results  indicate  that  scholars,  who  are  locally
central  (i.e., have many and strong direct contacts (co-authors) though restricted to co-authors that are the only access to
a  group  of  linked  researchers)  perform  better  than  the  ones  who  are  globally  central  in  the  network.  Degree  centrality  is  a
surrogate  for  local  centrality,  while  closeness  centrality  and  betweenness  centrality  show  how  central  a  node  is  globally.  We
can  explain  the  lack  of  effectiveness  of  closeness  and  betweenness  centralities  by  discussing  the  frequency  of  knowledge
exchange  between  scholars  and  their  direct  contacts  (co-authors)  rather  than  indirect  contacts  (co-authors  of  co-authors).
In  other  words,  the  number  of  co-authors  of  a  scholar  determines  the  opportunities  to  collaborate  and  exchange  knowledge,
leading  to  improved  performance.  Occupying  a  central  position  in  a  network  in  terms  of  closeness  and/or  betweenness  gives
only  strategic importance to the scholar but does not necessarily improve her performance. Therefore, having short paths
(i.e.,  high  closeness  centrality)  to  scholars,  who  do  not  have  a  direct  co-authorship  relationship  but  can  be  reached  via  a
co-authorship  path,  might  cause  the  exchange  of  redundant  knowledge.
The  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  considers  the  co-authors’  centrality.  Although  the  low  Spearman  rank  correlation
and  the  strong  negative  correlation  seem  to  be  contradicting  at  a  ﬁrst  glance,  they  ﬁt  considering  the  data  set  mixed  of
professors  and  students.  It  is  caused  by  the  fact  that  well-performing  professors  supervise  many  students,  which  have  a
low  eigenvector  centrality.  Consequently,  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  measure  of  the  well-performing  professor
is  low because of the many students with even lower eigenvector centralities. At the same time, it increases the normalized
betweenness  centrality since the performing professor provides the only connectivity for her students to other co-authors.
Consequently,  the  negative  regression  coefﬁcient  for  the  normalized  eigenvector  centrality  shows  that  the  well-performing
professor  is successful because of this supervision of many students instead of being connected with other well-performing
researchers.606 A.  Abbasi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Informetrics  5 (2011) 594–  607
Finally, access to demographic information of researchers (e.g., age, gender, and nationality) could be useful as moderating
variables in our model. We would be able to categorize researchers and analyze the outcome for each of the categories. It
could  help  us  ﬁnding  a  generalization  of  our  model.  The  current  lack  of  access  to  this  kind  of  information  can  be  considered
a  limitation  of  our  research.
Additional  social  context  information  of  authors  such  as  the  role  of  authors  (e.g.,  advisor,  student,  and  colleague)  could  be
useful  to  extend  this  research  to  perform  a  student-centric  study  of  scientiﬁc  collaboration  networks  following  the  research
of  Suresh,  Raghupathy,  Shekar,  and  Madhavan  (2007) .  It  would  allow  studying  the  dynamics  of  collaborations  between
students  and  professors.
